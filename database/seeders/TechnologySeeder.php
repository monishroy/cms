Electricity is the set of physical circumstances which is associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. By <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations'>Maxwells equations</a>, Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the occurrence of electromagnetism. Numerous common phenomena are related to electricity. Such as, lightning, electric heating, static electricity, electric discharges and many more. The existence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, manufactures an electric field. The motion of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. Some of the most important pioneers in electrical engineering include electric light bulb-Thomas Edison, alternating current- George Westinghouse, induction motor-<a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikola-Tesla'>Nikola Tesla</a>, radio invention- Guglielmo Marconi and television by Philo T. Farnsworth. These explorers spin ideas and concepts about electricity into practical devices and systems that conduct in the modern era.</p><p>Electricity was first come across in the 1700s by Benjamin Franklin. Benjamin Franklin performed the first electricity experiment in modern history. Since then, many others including Ampere, Ohm, Faraday, and Oersted managed to come about simple electrical devices after having appreciated the basic electrical principles. Much later, in 1904 Fleming’s diode started a new outlook for the advent of electronic components.</p><p><strong>What is Electrical Technology?</strong></p><p>The mother of all Industries is called Electrical Technology. This Technology is the important point of all Industrial factories. In our country, we are not only initiating the development of the power sector but also various industrial factories based on electricity.&nbsp; As a result, the demand for Electrical Engineering is increasing day by day. The Electrical Technology Program is an informative program that prepares individuals to apply technical knowledge and skills necessary to install, maintain, operate and repair electrically-energized residential, industrial and commercial systems, and DC and AC motors, controls electrical distribution panels. Instruction foregrounds practical application of mathematics, science, circuit diagrams and use of electrical codes and includes blueprint reading, sketching and other subjects essential for employment in the electrical occupations. Reading and description of commercial and residential building wiring codes and specifications, installation and maintenance of wiring, service and distribution networks within large building complexes are also critical ingredients of the program.</p><p><br><strong>Why Diploma in Electrical Technology?</strong></p><p>Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering Technology. It is the sector of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. These pioneers turned ideas about electricity into practical devices and systems that assist in the modern age. The first practical application of electricity was the telegraph which was invented by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1837. The need for electrical engineers was not felt until some 40 years later, upon the invention of the telephone (1876) by Alexander Graham Bell and of the dazzling lamp (1878) by <a href='https://dpi.ac/diploma-in-electrical-technology/'>Thomas A. Edison</a>. The field of electrical technology has grown and divided into a number of specific categories, including power generation and communication systems, motors, batteries and control systems.</p>",
